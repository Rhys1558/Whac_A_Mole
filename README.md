# Whac A Mole

I made a game of whac a mole using html, css and javascript. the game has a title, score, 
timer and a 3 by 3 gird of mole hills that has a mole random appear at one of the mole hills.
This project shows the power of vanilla javaScript. It shows the type of logic you can use to 
make anything you can image.

## Features

My website has multiple different features that all come together to show just how powerful JavaScript is.
